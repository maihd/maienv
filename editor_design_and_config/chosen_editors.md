# What and Why I'm use the editors
I'm using different editors for different projects. So I need this docs to make the choices clearly.


## VSCode
First from the list not because it's Mai main editor. But it's what I used to using commonly, which is new languages choice for implements syntax highlight first. So the reasons and guide to use VSCode:
- Have the extension with good support for the languages (or learning new languages)
- Some languages that I need to use as works, but not want to take time for write new syntax highlight in Lite
- Some languages that required complex features, much time to implement, hard to implement in Lite (Clojure with Calva)
- Commonly web dev and nodejs
- Good support for Vietnamese reading and writing.
- Writing docs, reading code.


## Lite
Mai main editor, sometime it's joy program to practice coding. The reason to used is simple: make my coding progress better.


## 4Coder
Best editor for C (maybe C-like languages). Support auto formatting code. Help coding faster. Not used it much, because the format C code not fit MaiCStyle. Learning more to custom it.


## Beef IDE
For Beef development. Don't know how to customize it.


## Visual Studio and native IDE
For debugging and profiling.


## Hacker editors
Used to using Emacs and Vim. But now quit because dont fluent coding with its anymore. Hard to turn back.
