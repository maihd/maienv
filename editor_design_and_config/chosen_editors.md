# What and Why I'm use the editors
I'm using different editors for different projects. So I need this docs to make the choices clearly.


## VSCode
First from the list not because it's Mai main editor. But it's what I used to using commonly, which is new languages choice for implements syntax highlight first. So the reasons and guide to use VSCode:
- Have the extension with good support for the languages (or learning new languages)
- Some languages that I need to use as works, but not want to take time for write new syntax highlight in Lite
- Some languages that required complex features, much time to implement, hard to implement in Lite (Clojure with Calva)
- Commonly web dev and nodejs, backends
    - NodeJS and web are main use cases of VSCode
    - GO, Haxe are have well supported
    - Good support for C#, but debugging may not good as Visual Studio. But VS is not an option for Mac.
    - Custom languages for web, backends are first targeting VSCode
- Good support for Vietnamese reading and writing.
- Writing docs, reading code.


## Lite
Mai main editor, sometime it's joy program to practice coding. The reason to used is simple: make my coding progress better.
Lite have advantages, that can be easily and fast to create custom language syntax highlighter. For experience with custom, unfamous languages. But no good as rendering multiple speaking languages, like Vietnamese, and typing UniKey simply does not work, so I choose VSCode for writing docs instead (researching to implement this in Lite).


## 4Coder
Best editor for C (maybe C-like languages). Support auto formatting code. Help coding faster. Not used it much, because the format C code not fit MaiCStyle. Learning more to custom it.


## Beef IDE
For Beef development. Don't know how to customize it.


## Visual Studio and native IDE
For debugging and profiling. Specially C/C++ projects. You need to support thoses IDE.
Maybe Unity and Dotnet, but exploring VSCode, because VSCode startup faster than VS (although VSCode is slow and ram exhausting).
And in Unity context, when work on MacOS, Visual Studio now abandon its port to MacOS, so VSCode is the first go.
-> Best CodeEditor/IDE for gamedev. 


## Hacker editors
Used to using Emacs and Vim. But now quit because dont fluent coding with its anymore. Hard to turn back.
Main reason to use Emacs is Lisp dialect.
