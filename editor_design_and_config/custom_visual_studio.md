## Font Rendering
- Visual Studio have issues on rendering fonts. The tricks is use 90%/110% (based on your font size).
- Change font size, repeat if the text rendered still bad.
- Use other fonts, font weights
- Options -> Text Editor -> Advanced:
    - Text formatting method: Ideal
    - Text rendering method: ClearType
- MacType should help, but you should use github releases, the version from the webpage is old and buggy.
