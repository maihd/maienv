# MaiHD coding/working environment
Unlike other hackers, I dont work on Linux or Mac much, so I cannot call maienv is yet another dot files repo.
I'm game developer/hacker, work mostly on Windows, the tools must have well GUI support, that how gamedev commonly works.
That's why maienv most things are about GUI, GUI code editor instead of TUI. 
One things are CmdLine with custom icon and theme, because default CmdLine icon and theme are not good. And I dont like Windows Terminal.
